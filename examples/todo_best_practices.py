# ‚úÖ GOOD EXAMPLES - These will create clear, actionable issues
# ==============================================================================

# TODO: Implement Redis caching layer for policy evaluation results
#       - Add Redis connection configuration
#       - Implement cache key generation based on policy + input
#       - Set TTL to 1 hour (configurable)
#       - Add cache invalidation on policy update
#       Expected Impact: 70% reduction in evaluation time
#       Estimated effort: 6 hours
class PolicyCache:
    pass


# FIXME: Race condition in concurrent policy evaluations
#        When multiple threads evaluate the same policy simultaneously,
#        the WASM instance state gets corrupted.
#        Reproduce: Run 10 concurrent requests to /evaluate endpoint
#        Solution: Add mutex lock or use thread-local instances
#        Priority: HIGH - affects production
def evaluate_policy(policy_name: str, input_data: dict):
    pass


# HACK: Using hardcoded timeout of 5 seconds
#       This should be configurable per policy or globally via config.
#       Some policies need more time for complex evaluations.
#       Related to issue #42 (performance improvements)
#       TODO: Create PolicyConfig class with timeout settings
EVALUATION_TIMEOUT = 5


# XXX: CRITICAL - Memory leak in WASM instance lifecycle
#      Memory usage grows by ~50MB per 1000 evaluations
#      Instances are not being properly garbage collected
#      Must be fixed before v2.0.0 release
#      See profiling results in docs/performance-analysis.md
def cleanup_wasm_instance():
    pass


# BUG: Null pointer exception when policy file is missing
#      Steps to reproduce:
#      1. Delete policy.wasm file
#      2. Start the application
#      3. Try to evaluate any policy
#      Expected: Graceful error with 500 status
#      Actual: Application crashes with segmentation fault
#      Stack trace: See logs/crash-2025-10-01.log

# NOTE: This algorithm was optimized for CPython 3.12+
#       Uses new PEP 669 monitoring features for better performance
#       Do not backport to Python 3.11 or earlier without modifications
#       Benchmark results: 40% faster than previous implementation

# ‚ùå BAD EXAMPLES - These create vague, unhelpful issues
# ==============================================================================

# TODO: fix this
# Problem: Too vague - what needs to be fixed?

# TODO add caching
# Problem: Missing colon after TODO - won't be detected
def bad_example_2():
    pass


# todo: improve performance
# Problem: Lowercase 'todo' - won't be detected

# Problem: Too generic - refactor what? how? why?

# ==============================================================================
# üí° ADVANCED EXAMPLES - For complex scenarios
# ==============================================================================

# TODO: [BACKEND] [P0] Implement circuit breaker pattern for external API calls
#       Context: External policy registry API is unstable (5% failure rate)
#       Requirements:
#       - Use pybreaker library (already in requirements.txt)
#       - Configure: 5 failures = open, 60s recovery time
#       - Add monitoring: expose metrics via /metrics endpoint
#       - Alert on circuit open: integrate with PagerDuty
#       Dependencies: #45 (monitoring infrastructure)
#       Acceptance Criteria:
#       [ ] Circuit breaker configured and tested
#       [ ] Metrics exposed and validated
#       [ ] Integration tests added
#       [ ] Documentation updated
#       [ ] Load testing completed (1000 req/s)
#       Owner: @backend-team
#       Due: 2025-10-15
#       Refs: ADR-015, RFC-042
class ExternalPolicyRegistry:
    pass


# FIXME: [SECURITY] JWT token validation bypassed in dev mode
#        SEVERITY: HIGH - Security vulnerability
#        Impact: Any request with X-Dev-Mode header bypasses authentication
#        This was added for local testing but made it to production!
#        Action Plan:
#        1. Remove dev mode check immediately (hotfix)
#        2. Add feature flag for dev features (proper solution)
#        3. Add security review process for auth changes
#        4. Audit all other dev mode shortcuts
#        CVE: Pending assignment
#        Reported by: @security-team
#        Fix deadline: 2025-10-03 (48 hours)
def validate_jwt_token(token: str) -> bool:
    pass


# HACK: [PERFORMANCE] Using eval() for dynamic policy generation
#       Why it's a hack:
#       - Security risk: arbitrary code execution
#       - Performance: ~100ms overhead per evaluation
#       - Maintainability: Hard to debug and test
#       
#       Proper solution:
#       - Use AST parsing instead of eval()
#       - Implement DSL (Domain Specific Language)
#       - Consider using Lark parser library
#       
#       Trade-offs:
#       - Current: Fast to implement, risky
#       - Proposed: Safer, better performance, more code
#       
#       Migration plan:
#       1. Implement AST parser (2 weeks)
#       2. Run both in parallel (A/B test)
#       3. Migrate gradually (feature flag)
#       4. Remove eval() after 100% confidence
#       
#       Estimated effort: 40 hours
#       Risk: Medium (requires careful testing)
def generate_dynamic_policy(code: str):
    pass


# TODO: [REFACTOR] Extract policy loading logic into separate module
#       Current situation: 300-line function doing too many things
#       Proposed structure:
#       - PolicyLoader: File I/O operations
#       - PolicyParser: Parse and validate policy syntax
#       - PolicyCompiler: Compile to WASM or bytecode
#       - PolicyCache: Cache compiled policies
#       
#       Benefits:
#       - Better testability (mock each component)
#       - Easier to understand and maintain
#       - Enables parallel policy loading
#       - Reduces coupling
#       
#       Migration strategy:
#       1. Create new modules with new code
#       2. Add feature flag: use_new_loader
#       3. Test thoroughly in staging
#       4. Gradual rollout: 10% -> 50% -> 100%
#       5. Remove old code after 2 weeks
#       
#       Related patterns: Strategy, Factory, Repository

# TODO: [PYTHON-3.13] Update to use new typing features
#       Python 3.13 introduces PEP 692 (TypedDict with NotRequired)
#       Current code uses workarounds for optional keys

# TODO: [AFTER-V2-RELEASE] Remove backward compatibility code
#       This code maintains compatibility with v1.x API
#       Can be removed after v2.0.0 is released and all clients migrate
#       Estimated 500 LOC can be deleted

#       Currently using wasmtime 0.27 (beta)
#       Waiting for stable 1.0 release (expected: Nov 2025)
#       Changes needed:
#       - Update requirements.txt: wasmtime>=1.0.0
#       - Update API calls (breaking changes in 1.0)
#       - Re-run benchmarks (performance improvements expected)

#        Failure rate: ~15% on CI, never fails locally
#        Symptoms: Timeout after 30 seconds
#        Suspected cause: Race condition in test setup
#        Workarounds tried:
#        - Increased timeout: didn't help
#        - Added sleep(1): reduces failures to 5%
#        Need to: Fix root cause, not mask with delays
#        Debug data: CI logs show deadlock in wasmtime.Store
